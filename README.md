# MixColors
This is an application (Mac/Win64/Win32) I made just to visualise the CodeChef problem "Mixing Colors". The link to the question is here: https://www.codechef.com/COOK86/problems/LIKECS05

Move into the folder version you want and pull the files. For Mac, add .app extension to the pulled folder if not already there.
